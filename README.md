This repository contains a Python project on weather forecasting

I have developed a model that can predict weather using previous data in this project.
 This project includes,

1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing data etc
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Plotting temperature, and precipitation trends over time
3. Model building: I used ARMA model for time series forecasting
4. Model evaluation: Mean absolute error, root mean squared error
5. plot the graph containing actual, training and forecast data.
